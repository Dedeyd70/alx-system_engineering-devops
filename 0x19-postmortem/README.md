#Summary: Email Communication Disruption

                        Timeline

Detection Time:   11th December 2023, 10:30am

Detection Method: The issue was detected when several employees reported an inability to send or receive emails. The corporate email server appeared unresponsive.

Actions Taken: The incident response team promptly initiated an investigation into the email server logs and network infrastructure.
Initial assumptions were that this might be a localized connectivity issue or an error in the email server configuration.

Misleading Paths: Investigations initially focused on potential server hardware failures, leading to temporary diversions from the actual root cause related to network misconfigurations.

Escalation: As the email outage persisted and communication disruption escalated, the incident was elevated to the network administrators and the IT leadership team.

Resolution: The incident was resolved by identifying and correcting misconfigurations in the network routing tables, restoring normal communication flow. Additionally, measures were taken to improve redundancy in the network infrastructure.

                Root Cause and Resolution

Root Cause: The issue originated from misconfigurations in the network routing tables, causing email traffic to be incorrectly routed, leading to communication disruptions.

Resolution: The immediate fix involved correcting the misconfigurations in the network routing tables. To prevent future occurrences, the incident prompted a comprehensive review and update of network configurations.

          Corrective and Preventative Measures

Improvements/Fixes: Enhance monitoring systems to include alerts for network misconfigurations affecting critical services.
Establish a protocol for regular audits of network configurations to identify and correct discrepancies.

                  Specific Tasks

Short-Term: Conduct a thorough analysis of all network configurations to identify and correct any potential misconfigurations affecting email services.
Implement additional monitoring checks for real-time detection of network routing issues.

Medium-Term: Review and update documentation for network configurations to improve transparency and knowledge sharing.
Conduct training sessions for network administrators on best practices for maintaining and updating routing tables.

Long-Term:Evaluate the feasibility of implementing redundant network paths to ensure continuity of critical communication services.
Establish a recurring schedule for proactive review and update of network configurations across the entire infrastructure.
